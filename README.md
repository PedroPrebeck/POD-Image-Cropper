# Print-On-Demand Image Cropper

This repository contains a Python program that can crop images for print-on-demand products using the PIL library. The program takes input files, manipulates them, and crops them to predefined dimensions, making them ready for printing on-demand products.

This program is intended to be used to produce images for print-on-demand products in Colab55 website. I intend to update this repository in the future to support other websites like RedBubble, Society6, Zazzle and more.

## Usage

To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Place the images you want to crop in the `input` folder.
4. Run the `main.py` script.
5. The cropped images will be saved in the `output` folder.

## Dependencies

This program requires the following dependencies:

* Python 3.5+
* PIL (Python Imaging Library)

You can install the dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
